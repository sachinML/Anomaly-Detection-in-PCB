# PCB_Anomaly_Detection
This is the project on detecting and classifying the anomaies in printed circuit board (PCB).
It Improves the performance of the PCB false alarm system by improving the F1 score using the various Deep Learning and Computer Vision methods.

Models which are used here for expermient-
  1. Base CNN
  2. ResNet 50
  3. Inception V3
  4. U-Net
  5. Convolutional Autoencoder.
